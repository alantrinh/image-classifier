# Image Classifier

Used a pre-trained neural network (MobileNetV2) and trained it on 4 classes of images to predict probabilites of real time images taken with the webcam belonging to a class of images.

Adjusted the `capture.py` file from https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier to use the model for realtime predictions
